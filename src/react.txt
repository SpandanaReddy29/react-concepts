React is an open source javascript library for building user interfaces for web applications.
React is a project created and maintained by Meta.

React allows to build complex Ui by breaking them into smaller reusable code called components
These components manage their own state, making it easier to build and maintain large scale applications.

JSX - JavaScript XML
      Which allows us to write HTML-like code eiyhin JavaScript
      Is used to define structure of components

React component - Is reusable building block for the UI
                  Which can be class or function which returns JSX

React - Is declarative in nature and not Imperative
        It doesnâ€™t allow u to interact directly with dom. It uses something called virtual DOM to do this process.

State - Is a component's built-in memory that stores data and information about the component
        It's a JavaScript object that determines how a component behaves and renders information to the user
        Components own and manage their own state
        State is mutable and managed within component itself

Props - Are read-only data passed from Parent Component to a Child Component
        Is used to communicate between two components
        It also allows the component content to be dynamic.
        Are managed and owned by Parent Component
        Props are immutable and are passed from parent to child component


Prop Drilling - Process of passing down props through multiple levels of nested components
                Can be overcome by using Context API, Redux

PropTypes - Defines the type of props that a function is expecting from its parent component
            its a library

Virtual DOM - Is a logical representation of actual DOM in form of React elements
              Is virtaul representation of UI

Reconciliation - Is the process of computing the difference between 2 Virtaul DOMS which is done through Diff Algorithm

Rendering - Updation of information in rendering environment, which happens after reconciliation

React Fragment - Is a way to group multiple elements without adding an extra HTML element to the DOM

npx - is npm package runner is installed during node installation

TYPES OF COMPONENTS - 

1) Pure Component - Optimize the rendering performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders

2) Higher Order Component (HOC) - Function that takes a component and returns a new enhanced component
                                  Used for code reusing, logic sharing and additional functionalities to components
                                  with keyword is used to write HOC       

3) Smart / Stateful / Container Component - Manages state, handles business logics and passes data down to Presentational components

4) Dumb / Stateless / Presentational - Only renders UI based on the props it receives, doesnt have any state or lifecycle methods       

5) Controlled Component - Value of input fields is controlled by React through state

6) Uncontrolled Component - Input fields maintains its own state using DOM    
                            React doesnt control the value, but can interact with input using refs
